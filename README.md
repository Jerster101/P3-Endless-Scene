Autotiling with greeen planet
Interactive element is erasure of content (removing stars/planets)

Artist Statement:  I immedietly wanted to try making a space scene, and I think it went well.  most of the noise is used to generate different star tiles while two larger ones are used to generate a small red planet and a large green planet.
